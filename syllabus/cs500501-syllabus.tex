\subsection*{Course Meeting Schedule}

Neither CMPSC 500 nor 501 have a set meeting time.  Instead, students are required to meet with the course instructor
during office hours for a total of 60 minutes.  These meetings must be scheduled through the instructor's reservation
system and documented on a meeting record that you submit on the last day of classes.

\subsection*{Course Catalogue Description}

\begin{quote}
A corequisite seminar for all students participating in the Internship Program.  Internship students enroll twice, once
prior to and once following the Internship. Computer Science 500 focuses on expectations and planning, leading to the
Internship Proposal required for all students planning an internship.  Computer Science 501 provides the opportunity for
students who have completed the Internship to prepare written and oral reports on the Internship experience. The
student, in consultation with the faculty of the Department of Computer Science, is responsible for arranging for an
acceptable internship.  The courses meet together weekly for one-half a semester. Credit: One semester hour for each
course. Prerequisites: Completion of at least two core courses.
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Course Objectives}

The students in CMPSC 500 will develop a list of internship and career resources, explore their internship and career
interests, and write a proposal for the internship that they will undertake. The course aims to help students
learn more about the field of computing and the positions that are available to computer scientists who graduate from
Allegheny College.  Overall, the course will provide a framework that enables a student to secure an interesting and
meaningful internship.

\noindent
The students in CMPSC 501 will develop a list of career resources, explore their career interests, write a final report
describing their internship, and give a public presentation about their internship.  This course gives
students who recently completed an internship a forum for sharing their experiences with the Allegheny College community.

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the
following categories. All percentages are approximate and it is possible
for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester if a
need to do so presents itself. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Class Participation and Instructor Meetings & 5\% \\
First Examination & 15\% \\
Second Examination & 15\% \\
Final Examination & 20\% \\
Laboratory and Homework Assignments & 30\% \\
Final Project & 15\%
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each of the above grading categories has the following definition:

\begin{itemize}

	\item {\em Class Participation and Instructor Meetings}: All students are required to actively participate during
		all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required
		reading assignments, asking constructive questions of your group members, giving presentations, and leading a
		discussion session. Furthermore, all students are required to meet with the course instructor during office
		hours for a total of sixty minutes during the Fall 2013 semester.  These meetings must be scheduled through the
